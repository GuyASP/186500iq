- I collaborated with a team of 5 to make a game with the OOP concept. Coding in Java.
- the game is a mathematics game. It gives the player 5 numbers, the first number is the answer. Other is an option. Players need to make an equation with the option number and given operator (+, -, *, /, !, Σ, ^, ∏ , √).
- My role is to design and implement a game's logic, such as math, when players win or lose, random numbers and countdown time.
